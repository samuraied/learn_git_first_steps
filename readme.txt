Enjoy learning, dont quit, believe in yourself,
If you have a hard time, take a break,
There is no shame in that, it's ok, relax,
Accept failure, learn from it, get back up,
Try again, and again,
There is no shame in failing,
There is shame in giving up,
Those who never fail, never try.

I know it sounds stupid.
I wish if someone told me this when i first started.
